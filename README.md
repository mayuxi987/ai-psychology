# Introduction

This is a collection for articles and resources relevant to AI + Psychology. 

Research shows that advanced AI language models, like GPT-4, can perform better than majority of human adults on complex tasks, such as the GRE and LSAT exams, which are typically faced by highly educated individuals at te top of the pyramid. However, these AI models still struggle with simple, everyday tasks that require common sense, like understanding unspoken thoughts and feelings, which even human babies can achieve. It seems that AI and humans follow quite contradictory developmental timelines: what's difficult for one is often easy for the other. Thus, it is interesting to investigate deeper in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Psychology to unreveal the following questions:


- What are the differences between mechanical minds and human minds? 
- How can we build computational modelling for human mental states and apply them to building AI models?
- How can we probe the psychology of models?
